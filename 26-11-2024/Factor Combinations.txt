You are given an integer n. 
Your task is to find all possible unique combinations of integers greater than 1 that multiply together to form n.

Each combination should be represented as a list of integers, 
and the combinations should be sorted lexicographically based on the factors. 
The output should not include duplicate combinations.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n where n > 1.

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: A list of lists, where each sublist contains integers that represent one valid factor combination of n.

15

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[[3, 5]]


Sample Input-3:
---------------
32

Sample Output-3:
----------------
[[2, 16], [2, 2, 8], [2, 2, 2, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [4, 8]]
